- During execution it takes IFSC code from the user.
- separate Key (bank shortcode) & value cust IFSC code.
- Read all data from IFSCdata.json file & append new/unique IFSC code in a specific place according 
	key value mapping in IFSCappendData.json file. 
- At the end for stability/consistency we copy appended data file content to an old json file.
